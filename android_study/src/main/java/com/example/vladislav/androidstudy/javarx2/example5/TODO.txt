This code is based upon the one present in example3.
- Cons: It has downloading and saving in one class - SOLID breaks, but correcting it, is not required in this example
        All 3 files have 1 progress textview
TODO
    Implement display of a downloading files like
        Name
        Progress bar (Current downloaded %)
    First, using only recyclerView then add a fragment, then add viewmodel.
    Try replacing current network layer with Retrofit
